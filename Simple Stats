### CARE trial "is there a benefit of pravastatin in cardiac outcomes when compared to placebo"###
### Read in the data ###

### break at summary statistics and quality of the data check ###

### group comparisions section below ###

prop.table(table(Session_1$group, Session_1$deathorMI),1)
# the probabliliity of the observed result or something more extreme under the null hypothesis #
# always report an estimate, a p value, and a confidence interval #
# a 0.05 p value assumes that a type one error will occur #
# State null, state type of data for explanation of outcome, determine appropriate stat test #
# State summary stats, calculate p value, decide whether to accept or reject null hypothesis, write it up #

### Chi squared test ###
# observed table compared to a table we would expect #
# reject null if p value is lower than 0.05 #
chisq.test(Session_1$group, Session_1$deathorMI, correct = F)
# this provides chi square and p value #
# correct = F is a continuity function. Stata does correct = F, R does not automatically without saying this. #

### Confidence intervals ###
# estimate of difference, range of plausible values, confidence interval based on sample size and sd #
# commonly used is the 95% confidence interval, related to p value of 0.05 #
# for more on math of CIs see the powerpoint for technicals #

Practice_dataset <- read_csv("/Volumes/Activities/Applied Biostats/MGH Biostats/Practice_dataset.csv")
# Investigating observational data #
names(Practice_dataset)
# sdmt is a measure of cognitive funcion #
# is there a difference between males and females in this outcome variable sdmt #
table(Practice_dataset$male)
prop.table(table(Practice_dataset$male)) # 76% male and 23% female
mean(Practice_dataset$sdmt)
sd(Practice_dataset$sdmt)
hist(Practice_dataset$sdmt)
boxplot(Practice_dataset$sdmt) #plot data to identify problems at outset
boxplot(Practice_dataset$sdmt~Practice_dataset$male)
plot(x=Practice_dataset$age, y=Practice_dataset$sdmt, ylab="SDMT", xlab = "Age (years)")

# Relationship between gender and SDMT #
mean(Practice_dataset[Practice_dataset$male==1,]$sdmt) #47 is the mean sdmt score for males
mean(Practice_dataset[Practice_dataset$male==0,]$sdmt)
sd(Practice_dataset[Practice_dataset$male==0,]$sdmt)

# Two sample t test #
# Null is that the difference between the two groups is 0 #
t.test(Practice_dataset$sdmt~Practice_dataset$male) #default is unequal variance, second var is grouping variable
t.test(Practice_dataset$sdmt~Practice_dataset$male, var.equal = T) #for equal variance
# This gives likilihood of the two means being equal given the sample 
# conclusion is that our male ms patients are not statistically different from our female ms pts based on sdmt
# in that 0 is one of the plausible values

# What is wrong with this command? 
t.test(Practice_dataset$sdmt, Practice_dataset$male) # is mean sdmt different from mean of 0 or 1 code for female or male

### Linear Regression ###
# allows a continuous outcome with a set of predictors
# beta 1 represents the difference in the means mean in males is beta 1 plus beta 0 for females it is beta 0
model <- lm(sdmt~male, data = Practice_dataset)
summary(model) # intercept is beta 0 (y-intercept), male is beta 1 (slope)
# since beta 1 has a negative value, then the females look to have a higher sdmt score
# Pr(>|t|) is our p value
# estimated beta 1 is -2.2 and p value is 0.23, therfore fail to reject the null
# is beta 1 equal to 0, intercept is mean of female sdmt scores
# confidence interval
confint(model)

### Try on own ###
# Is there a difference in sdmt scores when comparing ages
age_model <- lm(sdmt~age, data = Practice_dataset)
summary(age_model)

confint(age_model)

# shows that for one unit increase in age the sdmt score goes down by ~ 0.27 and it is stat sig p of 0.000273

### add more coefficients ###
multreg_model <- lm(sdmt~male+age, data = Practice_dataset)
# two parallel lines coefficients represent effects of gender or age holding the other variable constant
# diff btw males and females holding age constant or adjusting for age
confint(multreg_model)
# always assuming effects are linear #
